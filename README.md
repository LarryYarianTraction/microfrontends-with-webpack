# microfrontends-with-webpack

This repository is a monorepo containing the assets used during a Traction Talks Tech session on micro-frontends with Webpack5.

The sample project used in this presentation is based on a music service.  Users of the music service can add tracks to their library.  The music service also has a song recommendations section.  Using a micro-frontends approach, these two concepts are stitched together using Webpack5 and module federation.  A search feature is used to search both the recommendations and my library sections in a manner that allows for communication between different micro-frontends.

This may not be a perfect use case for micro-frontends but it is sufficient for the needs of our technical session.
